## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18.19.1 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alex-iurco/SpeedType.git
cd SpeedType
```

2. Install backend dependencies:
```bash
cd SpeedType/backend
npm install
```

3. Install frontend dependencies:
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### Development Setup

1. Start the backend server locally (optional, as production uses Railway):
```bash
cd SpeedType/backend
node server.js
```
The server will start on port 3001.

2. Start the frontend development server:
```bash
cd SpeedType/frontend
npm run dev
```
The frontend will be available at http://localhost:5173

### Production Deployment

The application is deployed using:
- Frontend: GitHub Pages with custom domain (speedtype.robocat.ai)
- Backend: Railway with automatic deployments
- Custom domain configuration with proper SSL/HTTPS support

For detailed deployment instructions, see the [Product Requirements Document](prd.md).

### Network Access
For local development, the backend server listens on all network interfaces (0.0.0.0).
In production, the application uses:
- Frontend: https://speedtype.robocat.ai
- Backend: https://speedtype-backend-production.up.railway.app
